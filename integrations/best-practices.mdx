## Where should I put my widget?

#### Place the widget in places where a user might see their asset overviews

* In dashboards

* In asset lists

**Place the widget in places where a user might need to top up their crypto in preparation for an action**

* Staking

* Pooling

* Swapping, etc

#### Place the widget in places where a user might need to top up their crypto in the moment

* When a user does not have enough for a web3 action  
   * _Example: User wants to do a swap on your app for 1500 USDC to 1 ETH, but only has 1300 USDC available in their wallet_  
   * _When the user clicks Swap and you've detected they have insufficient funds, call the Kado Ramp widget with params:_  
         * _`amount = 200`_ _(the difference in amount)_  
         * _`onRevCurrency = USDC`_ _(the asset that the user is missing)_  
         * _`wallet = [their connected user wallet]`_ _(sent directly to their connected wallet)_

#### Place the widget in places that a user might want to get their crypto back into fiat

* When a user wants to lock in crypto profits  
   * For DEXs or any apps where you can "sell" crypto into Kado-supported crypto assets  
         * _Example: User sells their 1 ETH for 1500 USDC_  
         * _Place the widget near the sell button or sell confirmation screen where they can then get their crypto back into their bank account_  
   * For staking, vault based protocols, or any apps that you can "harvest" crypto into Kado-supported assets  
         * _Example: User has a position farming for USDC rewards. Every week, they "harvest" their rewards and lock in their earned USDC_  
         * _Place the widget near the harvest button or confirmation where they can then off-ramp their harvest rewards back into fiat_

## Sizing 

* Test to ensure optimal widget placement to make sure that everything fits where you want it to

## Testing

* Test in your staging environments to make sure things are working how you want them to before pushing to production

## How should I close my widget?

* Make sure the widget does not close when a user clicks off of the widget - confine the close action to a close button or other explicit action. Otherwise, this could lead to users losing their progress and having to re-enter their information
