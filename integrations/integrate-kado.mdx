Integrating crypto on and off ramp services into your app or website can be a complex and time-consuming process, but it doesn't have to be.

Kado offers two main integration options that you can use to quickly and easily offer your users the ability to buy and sell digital assets, without the need to spend time building your own solution from scratch.

## Option 1 - Widget/iFrame

For teams that need an all-in-one solution that can be quickly integrated into your app or website without requiring additional development. Great if you don't want to spend the time and resources to build your own frontend. 

Custom URL parameters enable integrators to change the widget configuration with ease.

## Option 2 - Hybrid API / Minimal Widget/iFrame

For teams that want to build a custom front end for the process. Great if you want need more control over the user experience and want to integrate our services more deeply into apps and websites.

Note: the Hybrid API will soon support Swap, however only supports Buy or Sell today.
