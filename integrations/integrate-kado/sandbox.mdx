## Environment

The Kado Sandbox provides a safe space for integrators to try out their integration, without spending money or using real data. 

The sandbox can be located at:

* Frontend widget: [https://sandbox--kado.netlify.app/](https://sandbox--kado.netlify.app/)

* API: https://test-api.kado.money

## Sign Up

To create an account in sandbox, you will need access to the email you are creating the account with (for OTP sign in). 

If you wish to create multiple users with a single email address, you can add a `+` to your email account to receive emails to the original destination. For example, if your email is `test@example.com`, you can also create `test+1@example.com` and `test+2@example.com`, and all OTP codes for those users will show up at the `test@example.com` address. 

## KYC

Once you've signed up, you'll need to KYC to be able to test the on/off ramps. In the sandbox widget, continue on to the KYC process and select "USA" as your region.

After selecting "USA", a Plaid KYC widget will pop up prompting you for more information. Make sure to copy the phone number from the upper right side of the screen to autofill the rest of the KYC data and get accepted.

#### Approve KYC via API in Sandbox

If you just need a KYC'd user to test on/off-ramping, you can also sign up in the UI and then use the following API route to enable that user:
