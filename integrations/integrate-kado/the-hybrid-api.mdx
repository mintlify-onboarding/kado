Kado Hybrid API Integration

## Overview

Kado enables integrators to build a **(1) custom asset quote** and a **(2) post-order confirmation screen** that enables Kado to perform only the necessary functions for authentication/onboarding, add/edit a payment method, and provide users with an order summary screen.

**With this flow, integrators are able to redirect between their application and the necessary parts of Kado's application, to better control the user experience for their customers.**

Build a custom quote and order processing user experience to enable users experience a native application. This integration requires a bit more custom work vs. the [Kado Widget](/integrations/integrate-kado/the-widget).
