Integrate Kado Widget

## Overview

This integration allows you to add a customized Kado Widget to your web or mobile application. Kado Widget enables your users to on-ramp, to off-ramp, and to swap on-chain from our growing list of supported assets and networks.

Our widget includes everything that Kado Ramp has today - account creation, authentication, KYC, asset price quotes, payment processing, and transactions.

On-Ramp

* After a user completes KYC, to on-ramp, they can select the network and cryptocurrency asset that they want to buy, connect their web3 wallet directly or enter their wallet address, add a payment method, and confirm their purchase.

* Once the fiat payment method has been charged, Kado will disburse the purchased assets to the chosen destination.

Off-Ramp

* After a user completes KYC, to off-ramp, they can select the cryptocurrency asset that they want to off-ramp, select the network of that asset, determine where they will fund their off-ramp from, and select the fiat destination of their assets.

* Off-ramp funding sources can be either pulled directly from a connected Web3 wallet, or a user can manually send crypto to a Kado-provided wallet address. Once Kado receives the crypto funds, fiat will be disbursed to their selected destination.
